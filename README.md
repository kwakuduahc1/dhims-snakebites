<h1>Introduction</h1>
<section>
<p>Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease and presents a huge burden to the victims and healthcare systems. The victims of snakebites are mostly poor rural folks, farmers, and children.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 2016 to 2020 was extracted from the DHIMS database. Data from 3 facilities were exluded as they probably looked more of an error, e.g. recording over 1,000 cases of snakebites in an age group for a single month.</p>
<p>DHIMS categorises the age groups, they were further collapsed into fewer groups for easy presentation. The re-categorisation is arbitrary and does not represent any scientific process</p>
